 * Defines a type converter that converts an object of type F to an object of
 * type T using the specified AuraLocale to help resolve the conversion.
 * <p>
 * The implementations are located by naming convention in the
 * {@link org.auraframework.impl.java.type} package. For Array types, substitute
 * the [] in the type signature with the word "Array".
 * <p>
 * Similar to {@link Converter} but uses {@link AuraLocale} during conversion
 * between types.
 * <p>
 * If you're trying to convert from a String[] to an Integer[], you would create
 * an implementation called LocalizedStringArrayToIntegerArrayConverter then add
 * a static return method in {@link AuraImplConfig} that returns your new
 * {@link LocalizedConverter} class instance. Your converter can either
 * implement all the required methods listed here directly, or subclass a
 * non-localized version to pick some up for free.
